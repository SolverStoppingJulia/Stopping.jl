## How Stopping checks for optimality

The solver can let Stopping handles the optimality checks. We see here how it works and how to tune it in.

#Compute the score
#Compute the tolerances
#Test the score vs the tolerances

### FAQ: Does it work for vector scores as well?

### FAQ: How do I implement AND and OR conditions?

### FAQ: Do Stopping really computes the tolerances each time?
