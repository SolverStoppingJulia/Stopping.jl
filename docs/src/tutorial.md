## Tutorials and examples

Many tutorials and example are available [here](https://github.com/Goysa2/Stopping.jl/tree/master/test/examples), among them :

  * a basic Julia implementation of a Newton method using Stopping,
  * a Julia implementation of a penalty algorithm,
  * how to use **Stopping** to simplify benchmarking of algorithm and  
  * how to converting existing algorithms to **Stopping**.

If you encounter any problems with **Stopping**, please post an issue on [Github](https://github.com/Goysa2/Stopping.jl). Issues and pull requests will help improve **Stopping** as well as the documentation.
