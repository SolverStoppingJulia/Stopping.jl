"""
Type: LSAtT

Methods: update!, reinit!, copy

A structure designed to track line search information from one iteration to
another. If we have f : ℜⁿ → ℜ, then we define h(θ) = f(x + θ*d) where x and d
are vectors of same dimension and θ is a scalar, more specifically our step size.

Tracked data can include:
 - x : our current step size
 - ht : h(θ) at the current iteration
 - gt : h'(θ)
 - h₀ : h(0)
 - g₀ : h'(0)
 - current_time:  the time at which the line search algorithm started.
 - current_score: the score at which the line search algorithm started.

Note: by default, unknown entries are set to nothing.
